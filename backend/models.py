paragraph= """â€¢ Von Neumann Architecture 

It has a single memory storage to hold both program instructions and data, i.e., common program and data space. 
The CPU can either read an instruction or data from the memory one at a time (or write data to memory) because instructions and data are accessed using same bus system. 
The Von Neumann Architecture is named after the mathematician and computer scientist John Von Neumann. 
The advantage of Von Neumann architecture is simple design of microcontroller chip because only 
one memory is to be implemented which in turn reduces required hardware. 
The disadvantage is slower execution of a program. 
It is also referred as Princeton architecture as it was developed at Princeton University.
